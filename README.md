# Instagram-Clone- a one day project for Summer Internship Recruitments
 I have learnt Go for Backend within a short span and I am proud that I learnt this within a day.
 This happens because of the motive I had for joining a company for summer internship as I will be getting a lot of experience and knowledge which is
 important for my upliftment
 
 I have used GOLANG for Backend and MongoDB for storage and also HTML in places where it is necessary
 I have also attached a document which contains the output of my project
